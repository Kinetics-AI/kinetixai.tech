        bio: "Hongyang Li is an Assistant Professor at Musketeers Foundation Institute of Data Science, University of Hong Kong and has led OpenDriveLab since 2021. His research focus is on autonomous driving and embodied AI. He led the end-to-end autonomous driving project, UniAD and won the IEEE CVPR 2023 Best Paper Award. UniAD has a tremendous impact both in academia and industry, including the recent rollout to customers by Tesla in FSD V12. He created the first large-scale real robot ecosystem, AgiBot World, that systematically investigated the scaling law principles for robotic manipulation. He proposed the bird's-eye-view perception work, BEVFormer, that won Top 100 AI Papers in 2022. He served as Area Chair for CVPR, NeurIPS (including 2023 Notable AC), ICLR, ICCV, ICML, RSS, referee for Nature Communications, Guest Editor at Automotive Innovations. He is the Working Group Chair for IEEE Standards P3474 under Vehicular Technology Society. He is the Senior Member of IEEE, CCF and CSIG.
